# Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance & Object Detection

This project uses computer vision for real-time robotic navigation, combining edge density-based steering and object detection using MobileNet-SSD.

## Features

- Real-time video capture and processing via OpenCV
- Obstacle detection using edge density (Canny edges)
- Path planning by steering toward the least cluttered region
- Common object detection using pre-trained MobileNet-SSD (OpenCV DNN)
